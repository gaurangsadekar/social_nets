## Instructions to Run HW 1 Code

There is a file `solution.py` in every sub-question directory.
To run the solution in any file, simply run `python solution.py` in the terminal.

There is a copy of the dataset `caGrQc.txt` in every sub-question folder, so no paths and imports are necessary.

All code in this homework uses the `NetworkX` graph library of Python, which will need to be installed before any of the code can be executed.
